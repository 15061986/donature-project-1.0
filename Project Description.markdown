<h1>TechLabs #codeathome Bootcamp Project: Sustainability

<h3>Project Name</h3>
Donature

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
Donors and volunteers who wish to support nonprofits locally or internationally face a problem of not knowing which social impact organisations and sustainability projects they can assist or support. Similarly, nonprofits are unable to reach donors and volunteers through marketing or advertising. Donature solves this problem by serving as a one-stop-shop for organisations to fundraise, and for members of the general public to donate their money or volunteer their time.

<h3>Solution Pitch</h3>
Our project aims to bring together organisations and people who want to donate their time or money to social impact projects. The website allows people to easily identify the projects they would like to support since they are given a wide variety to choose from on an interactive map. Users can filter organisations/projects by country and/or by project area. Markers which show more information on individual projects will appear according to the selected filters. Our pilot version solely focuses on a water project located in Germany (that’s why there are only a couple of countries and causes currently displayed on the map). The map’s ease-of-use encourages people to utilise the product and more importantly, to contribute to a better world.

<h3>Impact on Sustainability</h3>
Donature is the first and only fundraising platform of its kind and magnitude in the world. There are no existing platforms that bring together so many meaningful projects and connect them with real people who have extra money to spare and extra time on their hands. Some organisations lack the means or know-how to reach large numbers of donors and volunteers online. Thus, Donature is a digital solution that makes this more accessible. Our aim with creating a platform that uses tech for social good is to raise people’s awareness of the importance of sustainability.
